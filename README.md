### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a robust Real-time Library Management System using ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework (EF) Core. The application aims to streamline library operations, allowing administrators to efficiently manage book records. It will include essential functionalities such as adding, updating, deleting, and viewing book details, ensuring data accuracy and availability.

### Key Activities
- **Project Setup**:Create a new ASP.NET Core MVC project,Configure Entity Framework Core for database interaction and Design a relational database schema for managing books.
- **Model Creation**:Define entity models (e.g., Book) with properties such as BookId, Title, Author, ISBN, PublishedDate, and IsAvailable.Apply Data Annotations for validation and database configuration.
- **Database Integration**:Configure the database context class for EF Core.Use migrations to generate and apply the database schema.
- **Controller and View Development**:Implement controllers for handling CRUD operations.Create Razor views for user interaction, including forms for adding/editing books and pages for viewing/deleting book records.
- **Business Logic Implementation**:Add logic to ensure data validation and error handling.Implement search and filtering features to enhance usability.
- **Testing and Debugging**:Perform unit and integration testing to ensure functionality.Debug and resolve any issues in the application.
- **Deployment**:Deploy the application to a suitable hosting environment for real-time accessibility.

### Technologies Used
- **Frameworks and Libraries**:
- **ASP.NET Core MVC**: For building the web application.
- **Entity Framework Core**: For ORM and database interactions.
- **Languages**:
- **C#**: For backend logic and EF Core models.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For frontend design and interactivity.
- **Database**:Microsoft SQL Server or any other compatible RDBMS.
- **Tools**:Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code: For development.
- **Swagger**: For API testing.
- **Hosting Platform**:Azure, AWS, or any other cloud-based or local hosting environment.

### Key Insights
- **Entity Framework Core Simplifies Development**:EF Core significantly reduces the complexity of database management by providing seamless object-relational mapping and migration tools.
- **Data Validation with Annotations**:Leveraging data annotations ensures consistent and robust validation of user inputs, enhancing data integrity.
- **Scalable Architecture**:Using ASP.NET Core MVC promotes a clean separation of concerns, making the system easy to maintain and scale.
- **Real-Time Usability**:With its efficient CRUD functionality, the system is tailored for real-time operations, ensuring quick access and management of book records.
- **Enhanced User Experience**:Razor views and a well-structured UI enable administrators to perform tasks intuitively.
- **Future Scalability**:The system can be extended with additional features like user authentication, borrowing/return tracking, and analytics for broader functionality.
